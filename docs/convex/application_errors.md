If you have expected ways your functions might fail, you can either return different values or throw `ConvexError`s.

If you're using TypeScript different return types can enforce that you're handling error scenarios.

For example, a `createUser` mutation could return

```typescript
Id<"users"> | { error: "EMAIL_ADDRESS_IN_USE" };
```

to express that either the mutation succeeded or the email address was already taken.

This ensures that you remember to handle these cases in your UI.

You might prefer to throw errors for the following reasons:

*   You can use the exception bubbling mechanism to throw from a deeply nested function call, instead of manually propagating error results up the call stack. This will work for `runQuery`, `runMutation` and `runAction` calls in [actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions) too.
*   In [mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions), throwing an error will prevent the mutation transaction from committing
*   On the client, it might be simpler to handle all kinds of errors, both expected and unexpected, uniformly

Convex provides an error subclass, [`ConvexError`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/values.ConvexError), which can be used to carry information from the backend to the client:

```typescript
import { ConvexError } from "convex/values";
import { mutation } from "./_generated/server";

export const assignRole = mutation({
  args: {
    // ...
  },
  handler: (ctx, args) => {
    const isTaken = isRoleTaken(/* ... */);
    if (isTaken) {
      throw new ConvexError("Role is already taken");
    }
    // ...
  },
});
```

### Application error `data` payload[â€‹](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/application-errors#application-error-data-payload "Direct link to application-error-data-payload")

You can pass the same [data types](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types) supported by function arguments, return types and the database, to the `ConvexError` constructor. This data will be stored on the `data` property of the error:

```typescript
// error.data === "My fancy error message"
throw new ConvexError("My fancy error message");

// error.data === {message: "My fancy error message", code: 123, severity: "high"}
throw new ConvexError({
  message: "My fancy error message",
  code: 123,
  severity: "high",
});

// error.data === {code: 123, severity: "high"}
throw new ConvexError({
  code: 123,
  severity: "high",
});
```

Error payloads more complicated than a simple `string` are helpful for more structured error logging, or for handling sets of errors differently on the client.

On the client, application errors also use the `ConvexError` class, and the data they carry can be accessed via the `data` property:

```typescript
import { ConvexError } from "convex/values";
import { useMutation } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

export function MyApp() {
  const doSomething = useMutation(api.myFunctions.mutateSomething);
  
  const handleSomething = async () => {
    try {
      await doSomething({ a: 1, b: 2 });
    } catch (error) {
      const errorMessage =
        // Check whether the error is an application error
        error instanceof ConvexError
          ? // Access data and cast it to the type we expect
            (error.data as { message: string }).message
          : // Must be some developer error,
            // and prod deployments will not
            // reveal any more information about it
            // to the client
            "Unexpected error occurred";
      // do something with `errorMessage`
    }
  };
  // ...
}
